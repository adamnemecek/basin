/// Levenberg-Marquardt solver for nonlinear least-squares problems

/// 1999 smooth μ-update.
///
/// Each iteration solves the damped normal equations
/// `(JᵀJ + μ·D) h = −Jᵀr` via Cholesky, then adapts the damping
/// parameter μ from the gain ratio
/// `ρ = (F(x) − F(x+h)) / (L(0) − L(h))` (Nielsen eq. 2.2). On a
/// successful step (ρ > 0) μ is reduced via the smooth cubic
/// `μ ← μ · max(1/3, 1 − (2ρ−1)³)`; on a failed step (ρ ≤ 0) μ grows
/// geometrically `μ ← μ·ν, ν ← 2ν` with ν initialized to 2 — Nielsen
/// shows this avoids the discontinuities of the classical
/// multiply/divide threshold rule and lands roughly 25 % fewer
/// iterations on average. See Nielsen, *Damping Parameter in
/// Marquardt's Method* (IMM-REP-1999-05) for the derivation and
/// Madsen, Nielsen, Tingleff (2004), *Methods for Non-Linear Least
/// Squares Problems*, §3.2.
///
/// **Marquardt scaling (`μ·D`, not `μI`).** The damping matrix is the
/// diagonal of the Gram, `D = diag(JᵀJ)` — the per-parameter curvature
/// — rather than the identity. This makes the trust region ellipsoidal
/// in the metric of the columns of `J`, so the algorithm is invariant
/// to diagonal rescaling of the parameters (Marquardt 1963; Moré 1978,
/// *The Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm: Implementation and Theory*).
/// Isotropic `μI` damping over-damps well-scaled directions and
/// under-damps poorly-scaled ones when the columns of `J` have very
/// different norms (e.g. parameters in a mixed log/linear/angle
/// encoding), which biases the step and can pull the iterate into a
/// worse basin. `D` is maintained as a **monotone running max**
/// `D_k = max(D_{k−1}, diag(J(x_k)ᵀJ(x_k)))` so a column whose
/// curvature momentarily drops keeps the damping floor it earned
/// earlier (Moré 1978; the same safeguard MINPACK applies to its
/// column-norm scaling). Columns that are exactly zero at `x₀` (a
/// parameter with no first-order effect on any residual) would make
/// `μ·D` vanish there and the Gram singular; following MINPACK, their
/// scale is floored to `1` at `init` (see [`FloorZerosInPlace`]), so a
/// fully-insensitive parameter stays put rather than failing Cholesky.
///
/// Initial damping is `μ₀ = τ` — dimensionless, because the
/// per-parameter magnitude now lives in `D` (the initial per-column
/// damping is `τ·diag(J(x₀)ᵀJ(x₀))`). τ is the *relative* trust
/// parameter; use a smaller value (e.g. `1e-6`) when `x₀` is believed
/// close to the optimum, larger (e.g. `1.0`) when far. Default
/// `τ = 10⁻³` matches Nielsen's "moderate trust" recommendation.
///
/// **Cholesky-on-(JᵀJ + μ·D) vs QR-on-stacked-system.** The damping
/// makes the SPD path strictly better-conditioned than pure
/// Gauss-Newton's `JᵀJ` — `μ·D` regularizes the rank deficiency that
/// makes GN fail. We stay on the SPD path because that's the only one
/// the [`linalg`](crate::core::math) tier exposes today, and the
/// regularization is sufficient for unconstrained LM.
/// QR-on-stacked-system (`[J; √(μD)]`) is more robust to ill-conditioned
/// `J` near rank deficiency but adds a second factorization route to
/// the linalg surface; deferred until S6 (TRF), where rank-deficient
/// Jacobians and box constraints make QR materially better.
///
/// # Failure modes
///
/// - **Cholesky failure under bumped μ.** When the initial damping is
///   too small to make `JᵀJ + μ·D` SPD (effectively never, for any
///   sensible `JᵀJ` and finite μ), the inner damping loop bumps μ via
///   `μ := μ·ν, ν := 2ν` and retries. Default
///   [`max_inner_attempts`](Self::max_inner_attempts) is 50 — far more
///   than enough; in practice the first attempt succeeds. If the cap
///   is exhausted (μ overflowing to `inf`), the solver returns
///   [`TerminationReason::SolverFailed`]. Note that bumping μ cannot
///   rescue a coordinate whose `D` entry is zero (`μ·0 = 0`); the
///   `init` zero-column floor exists precisely to keep `D > 0`.
/// - **Divergence on highly nonlinear / poorly initialized problems.**
///   The damping itself prevents divergent steps (failed steps are
///   rejected via the gain-ratio test), so divergence manifests as
///   μ growing without bound. Catch this with
///   [`MaxIter`](crate::core::termination::MaxIter) on the executor.
///
/// # Termination
///
/// Beyond the framework criteria
/// ([`MaxIter`](crate::core::termination::MaxIter),
/// [`CostTolerance`](crate::core::termination::CostTolerance),
/// [`ParamTolerance`](crate::core::termination::ParamTolerance), …),
/// the solver emits [`TerminationReason::SolverConverged`] when any of
/// four MINPACK-style tests is satisfied — the same independent
/// `info`-code structure MINPACK uses, so converging on whichever fires
/// first:
///
/// - **`tol_grad`** — absolute first-order optimality (Madsen et al.
///   eq. 3.3a): `‖Jᵀr‖_∞ ≤ tol_grad`. Default `1e-8`; `0.0` disables.
/// - **`tol_grad_rel`** — relative first-order optimality, MINPACK
///   `gtol` (Moré 1978): the cosine of the angle between the residual
///   `r` and every column of `J`,
///   `max_j |gⱼ| / (‖J·,ⱼ‖ · ‖r‖) ≤ tol_grad_rel`. This measure is
///   dimensionless — invariant to scaling the residuals — so a single
///   tolerance is portable across problems whose residuals carry
///   different normalizations (where the absolute `‖Jᵀr‖_∞` is too
///   tight for some and too loose for others). Default `0.0`
///   (disabled); set e.g. `1e-8` for parity. The per-column norms
///   `‖J·,ⱼ‖ = √diag(JᵀJ)ⱼ` reuse the Marquardt scaling diagonal the
///   solver already forms.
/// - **`ftol`** — relative cost reduction, MINPACK `ftol` (Moré 1978):
///   `|actred| ≤ ftol·F  ∧  prered ≤ ftol·F  ∧  ρ ≤ 2`, with the actual
///   and *predicted* per-iteration reductions in `F = ½‖r‖²`. The
///   `prered` clause is what the framework's
///   [`RelativeCostTolerance`](crate::core::termination::RelativeCostTolerance)
///   cannot express — it gates on the LM model, so the solver iterates
///   through temporary settling points (small actual gain, large
///   predicted gain) instead of stopping short. Default `0.0`
///   (disabled). See [`ftol`](Self::ftol).
/// - **`xtol`** — relative step, MINPACK `xtol` (Moré 1978):
///   `‖h‖ ≤ xtol·‖x‖`. Default `0.0` (disabled). See [`xtol`](Self::xtol).
///
/// The two gradient tests run before the step is computed (a step at a
/// stationary point is wasted); `ftol`/`xtol` run after, since they need
/// the attempted step and its predicted/actual reduction.
///
/// LM deliberately leaves `state.gradient = None` — the framework's
/// [`GradientTolerance`](crate::core::termination::GradientTolerance)
/// uses the L2 squared norm and is the wrong metric for NLLS, where
/// the canonical first-order test is the ∞-norm of `Jᵀr`. Same choice
/// as [`GaussNewton`](super::GaussNewton).
///
/// # Backends
///
/// LA-heavy: nalgebra (`DVector<f64>` / `DMatrix<f64>`) and faer
/// (`Col<f64>` / `Mat<f64>`) at the dense tier; nalgebra-sparse
/// (`DVector<f64>` / `CscMatrix<f64>`) and faer-sparse (`Col<f64>` /
/// `SparseColMat<usize, f64>`) at the sparse tier. `Vec<f64>` and
/// `ndarray::Array1<f64>` produce a compile-time error per tenet 5.
/// The sparse damping path requires the diagonal of `JᵀJ` to be in the
/// CSC pattern (always true when `J` has no zero columns); see
/// [`AddDiagonalVectorInPlace`] and [`MatDiagonal`].
///
/// # State convention
///
/// `state.cost` carries the LM convention `½‖r‖²`, derived from the
/// residual the solver evaluates itself. The bound on `P` is
/// [`Residual`] + [`Jacobian`], not
/// [`CostFunction`](crate::core::problem::CostFunction); problems
/// whose user-facing `cost()` uses an unscaled `Σ rᵢ²` form will see
/// `state.cost()` differ from `problem.cost(state.param())` by a
/// factor of two. Both go to zero at the optimum, so cost-based
/// termination criteria are unaffected.
