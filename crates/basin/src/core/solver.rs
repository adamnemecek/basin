///   termination checks before each iteration including iter 0. See the

///   loop ordering.
/// - **Implementor must:** populate every state field termination
///   criteria might read before returning from
///   [`init`](Self::init) — at minimum [`State::cost`] for any state
///   whose `cost()` panics on missing data, and
///   [`GradientState::gradient`](crate::core::state::GradientState::gradient)
///   for first-order solvers. After every successful
///   [`next_iter`](Self::next_iter), the same fields must again
///   correspond to the *current* [`State::param`].
/// - **Implementor must:** report mid-iteration failures
///   (line-search bailout, non-descent direction, etc.) via
///   [`next_iter`](Self::next_iter)'s `Option<TerminationReason>`
///   return rather than panicking; and use [`terminate`](Self::terminate)
