//! Dense linear-algebra ops for LA-heavy solvers (Gauss-Newton,
//! Levenberg-Marquardt, TRF). This is the second math tier per
//! `AGENTS.md` tenet 5: only backends that can implement these
//! operations honestly (currently nalgebra and faer) carry impls.
//! `Vec<f64>` and `ndarray` deliberately do not — there's no honest
//! `LinearSolveSpd` story for either at the dense level (no matrix
//! type for `Vec`; `ndarray-linalg` requires system BLAS/LAPACK and
//! breaks the wasm-default tenet).
//!
//! The op set covers what Gauss-Newton needs at minimum, plus a
//! least-squares solve for sparse backends that ship QR:
//!
//! - [`MatVec`]: `y = A x` (matrix-vector product).
//! - [`MatTransposeVec`]: `y = Aᵀ x` (transposed matrix-vector
//!   product — used to form `Jᵀ r` without materializing `Jᵀ`).
//! - [`GramMatrix`]: `G = Aᵀ A` (the SPD normal-equations matrix).
//! - [`LinearSolveSpd`]: `A x = b` for SPD `A` (Cholesky inside).
//! - [`LinearSolveLstsq`]: `min_x ‖A x − b‖₂` (QR inside). Implemented
//!   per-backend wherever a sparse QR exists; not all backends do.
//!
//! Dense LU and `(AᵀA) x` for matrix-free Krylov inner solves are
//! deliberately deferred — they land alongside the first solver that
//! actually wants them (post-S6).
